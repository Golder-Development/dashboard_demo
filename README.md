# Paul Golder - StreamList Political Donations Dashboard

## Created During Course with Code institute

* Currently built to work on Python 3.10.11 - may work on more recent releases.
* This repo was built based on learning with aid from ChatGpt and codepilot for issue fixing 
    and also development guidance.
* A hosted version of the dashboard should be available at
    -   https://golder-development-dashboard-demo-politicalpartyanalysis-rctb68.streamlit.app/

* When first run the dashboard undertakes a data refresh which involves a level of deduplication
    this can take several minutes, the "Please wait while the data sets are being calculated" 
    message will disappear when processing has completed.
* Please review the "Notes on Data and Manipulations" page of the app for assumptions and 
    data manipulations undertaken as part of the analysis.
* Please credit "https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulgolder/" if you use this repo or the calculations
    in it in your own developments.
